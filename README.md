# Introduction 
The dataset used in this analysis is the "500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2018" obtained from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jennifersantiago/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-2018). It contains data for the 500 largest cities within the US. The dataset has 810103 rows and 25 columns that include information such as state, city name, population, geolocation, and 27 measures for chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors, health outcomes, and use of preventive services. Our dataset has a total of 7 float, 2 int, and 16 object/categorical values. 

# Problem Statement: 
A pharmacy company wants to launch a drug for diabetes in one of the following states: CA, TX, FL, and NY. The drug is primarily intended for the treatment of diabetes, but it may also have potential benefits for improving mental and physical health.

The aim of this data visualization project is to provide insights into the prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, preventive measures taken by the population, and the trend of diabetes in four states for the year of 2016.

Using data visualization techniques such as pie charts, bar graphs, line graphs, and heat maps, the project aims to identify the top state with the highest number of people with diabetes and recommend a city for the launch of the medicine.

# Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of health data for the states of TX, CA, NY, and FL, California appears to be the state with the highest prevalence of diabetes, poor physical health, and poor mental health. 

Additionally, when compared to the respective prevalence population, California has the highest percentage of people who are obese, have insufficient sleep, and lack physical activity. 

Los Angeles, in particular, has been identified as the city with the highest prevalence of diabetes in California. Therefore, it would be a wise decision to launch the new drug in Los Angeles, California. 

Furthermore, a significant portion of the population lack health insurance and goes for annual checkups. This information suggests that there is a potential market for low-cost drug in Los Angeles where a large number of people fall into this category.
